		As a child, my imagination was my playground. Using crayons, play-doh, lincoln logs, and legos, I would create my own worlds and fill them with my own creations. I loved the ability to bring my ideas to life and share them with others.
	</p>

	<p>
		As I've grown, my passions have evolved and my tools have become more sophisticated, but my love for creating and bringing ideas to life has never wavered. I've explored music, woodworking, metalsmithing, 3D modeling, web development, game development, and even AI-assisted design. There is always something to learn and I'm always looking for new ways to express myself.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm truly grateful to have the opportunity to use my creative talents in my work as a developer and designer. It's a gift that I cherish every day.
