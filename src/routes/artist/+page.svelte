	<p>
		As a child you could always find me lost in thought creating imaginary worlds. Using crayons and
		play-doh, lincolns and legos, I would build up the world around me as I saw fit.
	</p>

	<p>
		I loved the ability to pull something from your mind and put it into the world for others to
		see. As I've grown, I've never lost that passion. You can still find me lost in thought creating
		imaginary worlds, but the tools and the mediums have evolved beyond scented markers and paper
		mache.
	</p>

	<p>
		I've gone from music to woodworking, metalsmithing to 3D modelling, web development to game
		development, and as of late I've been using AI assisted tools to inform my creations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Being able to leverage these creative abilities through my work as a developer and designer is a
		gift that I am thankful for daily.
