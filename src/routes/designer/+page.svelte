	<p>
		Design is the perfect combination of my two passions: art and technology. I love the process of
		creating designs and bringing them to life with code. I'm a firm believer in the atomic design
		principles, and I always make sure to structure my designs in a way that allows for easy reuse
		and scalability. This saves a lot of time and effort in the development phase.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm always looking for new styles and techniques to experiment with, and I'm known for thinking
		outside of the box. I use Figma as my primary design tool, but I also have experience with a
		variety of other design and art tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		I mostly do design for my personal projects, but my design skills are also useful in my work as
		a developer, where I often collaborate with designers and UX experts to achieve the client's
		vision. Overall, I'm passionate about design and committed to creating beautiful and effective
		user experiences.
