	<p>
		Design takes two of my passions; art and technology, and combines them into one. I love being
		able to layout designs and bring them to life with code. I follow the atomic design principles
		when working out the structure of my designs It's important that the components are reusable and
		scalable and sorting this out during the design process can save a lot of time in development. I
		like to experiment with new styles and techniques, and am known for thinking outside of the box.
	</p>
	<p>
		I use Figma for most of my work these days, but that is augmented with a variety of other design
		and art tools. I mostly do design for my personal work, but this skillset has proven to be
		invaluable as I collaborate with Designers and UX to achieve the clients vision with my
		development work.
