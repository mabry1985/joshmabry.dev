	<p>
		As soon as I began coding, I was hooked. I love the challenge of solving complex problems, the
		thrill of creating something new, and the satisfaction of building something that can be used by
		others. My goal is to make my work as accessible and inclusive as possible, and I'm always
		looking for ways to enhance the user experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm passionate about front-end development and user experience, and I have a deep understanding
		of component-based architecture and modular systems. I'm also experienced in working with the
		entire tech stack, from the front end to the back end.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to staying up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies, I'm a strong believer
		in the benefits of typed languages and DRY code. I believe that these practices help me to write
		clean, efficient, and maintainable code, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills
		and techniques in these areas.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm excited to continue learning and growing in my field, and I'm always open to new challenges
		and opportunities.
