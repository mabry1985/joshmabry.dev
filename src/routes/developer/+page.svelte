		When I first realized my love for coding, I couldn't believe I hadn't discovered it sooner. I
		enjoy the problem solving, the creativity, and the ability to build something that can be used
		by others. I aim to incorporate accessibility and inclusivity into my work, and I'm always
		looking for ways to improve the experience of the user.
	</p>
	<p>
		My skillset is full-stack and I'm comfortable working with a variety of technologies, but my
		passion is in front-end development and user experience. I love component based architecture and
		modular systems and I'm always keeping up with the latest trends and technologies. It's a
		bottomless well of knowledge and I can't wait to see what I learn next.
