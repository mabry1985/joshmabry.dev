	<p>👋🏻 Hello, I'm Josh Mabry and I like to make stuff!</p>

	<p>
		Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I still reside in Portland, Oregon. Here we've got great
		nature within arms reach and some of the best beer and food in the world.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not coding, you can find me playing videogames, sim-racing in VR, or enjoying a nice
		meal with my wife
