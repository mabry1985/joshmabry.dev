	<p>
		Hi, I'm Josh Mabry. I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, where I still reside. I enjoy living in the Pacific Northwest, where we have access to great nature and some of the best food and beer in the world.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not working, I enjoy playing making art, playing games, and spending time with my wife. I'm also an avid foodie and I thing there is nothing better than a nice meal with good people.
